  <Param type="RichAbsPerc" min="0" value="1" max="240.784" description="Precision" name="CellSize" tooltip="Size of the cell, the default is 1/50 of the box diag. Smaller cells give better precision at a higher computational cost. Remember that halving the cell size means that you build a volume 8 times larger."/>

Values greater than zero mean an external surface, and lower than zero mean an internal surface.&lt;br> In practice this value is the threshold passed to the Marching Cube algorithm to extract the isosurface from the distance field representation."/>
  <Param type="RichBool" value="true" description="Clean Vertices" name="mergeCloseVert" tooltip="If true the mesh generated by MC will be cleaned by unifying vertices that are almost coincident"/>
  <Param type="RichBool" value="false" description="Discretize" name="discretize" tooltip="If true the position of the intersected edge of the marching cube grid is not computed by linear interpolation, but it is placed in fixed middle position. As a consequence the resampled object will look severely aliased by a stairstep appearance.&lt;br>Useful only for simulating the output of 3D printing devices."/>
  <Param type="RichBool" value="true" description="Multi-sample" name="multisample" tooltip="If true the distance field is more accurately compute by multisampling the volume (7 sample for each voxel). Much slower but less artifacts."/>
  <Param type="RichBool" value="false" description="Absolute Distance" name="absDist" tooltip="If true a &lt;b> not&lt;/b> signed distance field is computed. In this case you have to choose a not zero Offset and a double surface is built around the original surface, inside and outside. Is useful to convrt thin floating surfaces into &lt;i> solid, thick meshes.&lt;/i>. t"/>

  <Param type="RichFloat" value="1" description="Boundary Preserving Weight" name="BoundaryWeight" tooltip="The importance of the boundary during simplification. Default (1.0) means that the boundary has the same importance of the rest. Values greater than 1.0 raise boundary importance and has the effect of removing less vertices on the border. Admitted range of values (0,+inf). "/>

"/>
  <Param type="RichBool" value="false" description="Planar Simplification" name="PlanarQuadric" tooltip="Add additional simplification constraints that improves the quality of the simplification of the planar portion of the mesh, as a side effect, more triangles will be preserved in flat areas (allowing better shaped triangles)."/>

  <Param type="RichBool" value="false" description="Weighted Simplification" name="QualityWeight" tooltip="Use the Per-Vertex quality as a weighting factor for the simplification. The weight is used as a error amplification value, so a vertex with a high quality value will not be simplified and a portion of the mesh with low quality values will be aggressively simplified."/>
